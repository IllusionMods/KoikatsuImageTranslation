# Koikatsu! Image Translation
This is an English translation of the Illusion eroge [Koikatu](http://illusion.jp/preview/koikatu/) and its English version [Koikatsu Party](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1073440/__Koikatsu_Party/) (the English release doesn't translate Studio and expansion content, this fills in the gaps). This project only translates images. For text check [bbepis/KoikatsuTranslation](https://github.com/bbepis/KoikatsuTranslation) and [DeathWeasel1337/Koikatsu-Translations](https://github.com/DeathWeasel1337/Koikatsu-Translations).

This plugin uses [AutoTranslator](https://github.com/bbepis/XUnity.AutoTranslator) to translate images in the game without modifying any game files.

## How to install
1. Install the latest [AutoTranslator](https://github.com/bbepis/XUnity.AutoTranslator/releases).
2. Download the latest release from the [releases](https://github.com/IllusionMods/KoikatsuImageTranslation/releases) page.
3. Remove your old `\BepInEx\Translation\en\Texture` folder, especially if you have Koikatsu Party (not as important for Koikatu).
4. Extract the archive into your game directory.
5. If you have Koikatsu Party (not Koikatu) remove `\BepInEx\Translation\en\Texture\Koikatu.zip` to prevent translation collisions.

## Contributing
When you have translations to submit [fork the repository](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/). Upload your changes to your fork and then [submit a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/). Your pull request will be reviewed and accepted after a quality check. Again, no raw machine translations will be accepted. Proper capitalization, punctuation, and spelling is a must.
